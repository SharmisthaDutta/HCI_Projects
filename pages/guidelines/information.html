        <h3>Guideline: </h3>
        <p>To know if someone is in control there should be a widget(label with text “user x is in control”/button which upon
             click shows the object owner) explicitly to notify all the users of the app.(not applicable if multiple
            users are allowed to edit simultaneously)<p>


        <hr/>


        <h3>Comments: </h3>
        <p>
            Provide a widget to let every user know who is in charge of the shared content. Without this information there
            will be confusion and distraction among users. However this rule applies to those multi-user apps that lets
            only one user to take control of and shared object at a given point of time. For example go to meeting,
             Skype for business when used for presentations.</p>

        <h3>Sources: </h3>
        <p>
            Multiuser voice channel sharing applications for to online meetings and collaboration services.
             These apps lets users  collaborate on documents, deliver presentations, perform product
            demonstrations and securely share confidential information from anywhere, at any time.
        </p>

        <h3>Good Example: </h3>
        <p>
            Skype for business has a label on top of shared content providing information about the in charge of
            shared content owner, which is very useful. For presentations it clearly shows who is in control
            and who is speaking</p>


        <hr/>

        <h3>Bad Example: </h3>
        <p>
            Go to meeting: It does to explicitely tell us the presenter or Organiser name.</p>
