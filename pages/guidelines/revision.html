        <h3>Guideline: </h3>
        <p> It is recommended by several users to show revision history of shared object where applicable and
         where the object is visible and include the time of editing the shared object and object owner.
         as this helps to resolve any conflicts that might come along with the collaboration.<p>

        <h3>Comments: </h3>
        <p>
            We personally came accross a user who used an multi user app for her course. It was a team project documentation and
          unfortunalety it let to a conflict amongst team members due to an issue of plagiarism. The app helped her to
          resolve the problem and prove her not guilty of plagiarism. So it was very helpful.</p>

        <h3>Good Example: </h3>
        <p>
            Google Docs</p>

        <h3>Bad Example: </h3>
        <p>
            Skype, Go to meeting: these apps allows sharing of voice among several users and do not inclusively provide this feature.
         However users can record the audio content using the Widgets provided in the user interface of these apps.</p>
