    <h3>Recording</h3>
    <p>Our ethnography study observed Andrew's son Benjamin for several hours while riding in the car to see his
        great-grandparents;
        the following video is spliced together from several segments before and after the trip:</p>

    <h3>Observations</h3>
    <p>Benjamin seemed relatively content for most of the trip. He seemed more attentive and interested
        in things to play with and outside events earlier during the trip; later, especially on the return trip, he
        preferred more passive activities like listening to music or holding his Elmo toy. During the initial period,
        however, he may have been interested in some sort of identification game: he liked pointing out things in his
        picture book and saying what they were. At times he would find one that he didn't know and say, "what
        that?". His attention span is short, though, so whatever application he would use would have to involve active
        widgets: involving discovery, identification, changing ways of play. Such an application might also benefit from
        adding the option of passive widgets: listening, watching, etc.</p>
    <p>There are other factors that may be impossible to control for a successful application: Benjamin's sleep levels,
        food intake, etc. However, there may be some interesting application that could track vital statistics and
        attempt to correlate them to his moods and/or inform his parents.</p>
