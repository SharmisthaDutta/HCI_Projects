    <h3>Questions and responses from focus group members </h3>
    <h5>Question from focus group: If we are driving only with the kid can the kid play the app on their own? </h5>
    <p>Answer from us: The app has/will have an auto mode option. So the kid will be able to play on their own.</p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <h5>Question from focus group: What if I can not pair up my devices using Bluetooth? Can I still be able to use the app? </h5>
    <p>Answer from us: The app currently is based on the idea of pairing an Adult's phone device with an Tablet to be more interactive. however
        <br>it is a good idea to have the app being run in single device without pairing with another device.</p>


    <h3>Summary of key findings </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Adult Mode Users of this app (i.e: Parents, Grandparents) wants variety of features in the app. For example<br>
        animated cartoons of illustrations and small videos. However that might increase the app size and complexity.
        </li>
        <li>We should be careful to choose the right colors in UI design of the app.</li>

        <li>We got a suggestion to use a timeout feature so that the game becomes more interesting.</li>
        <li> We should think, understand and come up with a good collection of illustrations that a toddler must be familiar with.
            <br> As an example Illustrations can be a Car, Dog or Apple, but should not be a Telescope which is unknown o a toddler in
            <br> most of the cases.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Key learning </h3>
     <ol>
         <li>While conducting the focus group we learnt that different people have different opinions and beliefs. It is not possible<br>
         to satisfy everyone and come up with a solution that works for all. However with some tweaks we can attract majority of users of an app.</li>
         <li> Since we have a limited time to implement the app we should focus on the main features we would like to include<br>
         to be able to present a engaging and interactive app for the toddlers </li>
