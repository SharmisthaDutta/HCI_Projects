        <h2> Special feature that we like</h2>
        <p>  During the meeting, hosts can share their desktop, a specific application, or files from their computer,
            including video. A module at the top of the host's screen shows whether sharing is switched on or not,
            so you don't leave that feature on after the meeting. You can also share a virtual whiteboard
            for sketches and notes. All sharing features can be used concurrently with video chat, which is helpful,
            and not available on some services, like GoToMeeting.</p>
