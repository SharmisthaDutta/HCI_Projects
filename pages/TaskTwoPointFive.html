    <h3>Open-ended Questions</h3>
    <h4>Adult: what did you like the best about the voice-enabled application?</h4>
    <p>Selecting illustrations was very simple in adult mode</p>
    <h4>Adult: what did you like the least about the voice-enabled application?</h4>
    <p>Not enough images, "hate the colors", "rhinoceros" not easily recognized</p>
    <h4>Adult: do you have any other comments, feature requests, or suggestions?</h4>
    <p>Would prefer iOS app</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>For adult users accustomed to Android's material design guidelines (and iOS applications), the adult mode
        navigation was exceedingly simple. Also, adults instantly learned how to identify illustrations and move to new
        illustrations from within child mode. A more diverse (e.g. older adults, minimally experienced phone users) test
        user distribution and a larger test sample size is needed for determining the success of the UI, but the target
        demographic, young adults with children, were quick to adapt to the user interface and implemented widgets.</p>
    <p>More importantly, the children...</p>
